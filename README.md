Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Our client, "The Gaming Room", had plans to develop a new web game. The given name of the game was "Draw It or Lose It". The client sought to have teams of multiple players be able to compete against each other 
from a variety of different platforms such as android and iOS. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I identified the constraints and priorities for the design of the application and used this information to create a list of recommendations to the client of system architectures 
that will allow them to reach their desired requirements. I gave detailed input on what recommendation I think is best for our project and I provide a brief description of why I choose said recommendation.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The domain model in the document really helped me identify the behaviors and relations between the different classes. The UML diagram helped in understanding the structure of the 
game application and relationship among the classes it is comprised of. This helps me understand how my code should be outlined in the application. Using the diagram, I where and how I should outline my code. This is because of the interaction
it might have with another class as seem in the UML diagram. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the server side development requirements. I would expand more in specific detail about the stengths and weakness of the different operating platforms. I would include details about each platform 
that include and are more tailored to system architectures. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When considering user needs, it is important to understand the user's perspective and why the needs are important for them. My implementation of the user needs was from a perpspective
in which I were playing the application I am developing. I want the application to be responsive and fast so I'm not feeling like I'm always waiting everytime I do an action. I also
might want to play with my friends, however, they don't have the same platform as me. To alleviate this, I would implement a cross-platform mwchanism or functionality that allows for the user to play with there friends even if they don't share the same platform.
As a developer, you want more people using or playing your application, because of this, it is important to consider the user needs so they don't feel compelled to stop using your application. User engagement can be a measurement of sucesss. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would outline design requirements, constarints, and developmental requirements. This would help me establish what is priority and what resources are needed to ensure the design can be completed.
I also want to identify my goal with the design. This can help organize and build upon each component from the bottom up.
